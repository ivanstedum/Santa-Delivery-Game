# Santa-Delivery-Game
Santa Christmas game created with C# and Unity, deliver the presents to all the children before time runs out!
# Introduction
I am still a novice in creating games, but I have been working on this game for a while. I've learned a lot, such as locating where certain items are, spawn points, camera tracking player, and game design with levels of difficulty in the game. I kept adding to the game, and I am satisfied with the game. In the game you play as Santa, who has lost all their presents and must pick them up and deliver them before time runs out. The countdown was actually difficult for me to learn, as I had to use the varaible from the Timer Class I created into my Delivery Class. However, I was able to figure it out!
# Inspiration
I have been taking the Intro to 2D Games with Rick Davidson on Udemy, where he creates a car delivery game. While I did learn how to create the "car" aka sleigh, "packages" aka presents from him, and "boosts" aka milk and cookies from him, all other game aspects are my own, such as the time, the spawn of the children, and more.
